                <h3>About The Author</h3>
                <p>Hi! My name is Liam Glendening, I am currently a senior enrolled at Michigan State University for Information Science. I was born in Kalamazoo, a city located in west Michigan, 150 miles from both Detroit and Chicago. I currently live and go to school in East Lansing, where MSU is located.</p>
                <p>My hobbies are all over the map in terms of focus areas, with me enjoying watching a variety of sports (baseball, football, college basketball, and hockey) to being on my computer, whether that being playing video games, or creating content for me and my friends YouTube channel. I also have recently got back into reading and am attempting to read many of the classic books that you could see on a “books everyone should read” list. I also enjoy learning and am always looking stuff up and researching for my own, and my mind is constantly filled with completely useless, albeit interesting information.</p>
